Area Calculator Using Abstract Class in Javaüî•

This project is to show the use of abstract classes and polymorphism in Java in calculating the area of geometric figures such as Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. It is a simple console-based application that illustrates basic OOP concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, and dynamic method dispatch.

Features :-
- Abstract class "Shape" with subclasses of its own: Circle(‚≠ïÔ∏è), Rectangle(‚ñ¨), Triangle(üî∫).
- Polymorphism at runtime using overridden methods called area()
- Clean and extensible object-oriented design
- Console I/O for user interaction

Future Improvements :-
- Calculations for perimeters
- Addition of more shapes (e.g., Square, Trapezium and many more to be added)
- GUI-based implementation using Java Swing or JavaFX
